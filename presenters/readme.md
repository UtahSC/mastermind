# Notes for presenters

This exercise allows for a couple of different difficulty levels.
Given roughly 50 minutes, most participants should be able to make significant progress to Part 1.
Faster participants can be challenged either with creating a UI or moving on to start attempting part 2.

If the participants choose, they can instead start from the Codebreaker side. 
This side is less testable, but more mathematically interesting. 
Many of the tools that were built in writing the Codemaster role will also be useful to the codebreaker (e.g. the scoring tool).

## Challenges while presenting

The scoring algorithm is somewhat complicated.
Be sure to explain that each peg in both the actual code and the guess should be scored at most once (once you've scored a peg as being in the correct position, it will not count as a peg that has the correct color and incorrect position)

## Learning objectives

This kata does not have as direct a link to TDD as many of the katas in the library.
As such, it serves as a chance for participants to practice decomposing a problem in such a way as to enable TDD.
